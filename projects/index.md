The Mosaic Lab tackles questions related to variation in human reproductive and perinatal traits. In particular, we are interested in knowing how variation in our DNA translate into variation in reproductive and perinatal outcomes. We combine large-scale genetic datasets with publicly available functional data in relevant cell types to understand the biological mechanisms behind such variation and inform laboratory follow-up. In sharp contrast with most traits, reproductive and pregnancy outcomes are largely shaped by two distinct, but correlated, genomes, the maternal and the fetal. While this complicates downstream analyses and interpretations, it makes research in this field particularly exciting and unique. In our group we have designed robust pipelines to tease out maternal and fetal effects and assess their interplay on multiple outcomes. More broadly, we are also interested in understanding other, non-genetic, sources of variation underlying traits related to reproductive and perinatal health.
