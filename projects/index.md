Our group tackles questions related to human reproduction. In particular, we are interested in knowing how variation in our DNA shapes reproductive and perinatal outcomes. We combine large-scale genetic datasets with publicly available functional data in relevant cell types. In sharp contrast with most traits, reproductive and pregnancy outcomes are largely shaped by two distinct, but correlated, genomes, the maternal and the fetal. While this complicates downstream analyses, it makes research in this field particularly exciting and unique. In our group we have designed robust pipelines to tease out maternal and fetal effects and assess their interplay. At the same time, our research encompasses the understanding of the sources of variation underlying traits related to reproductive and perinatal health.
