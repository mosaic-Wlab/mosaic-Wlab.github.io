# Curiosity-driven research with clinical potential     

We are an interdisciplinary team, a scientific mosaic, driven by curiosity to answer critical questions in reproductive and perinatal medicine. By integrating computational biology with large-scale genetic and registry data, we aim to understand the mechanisms behind pregnancy loss and other pregnancy and neonatal outcomes. Our ultimate goal is to transform reproductive biology and advance molecular diagnostics. We believe in collaborative work and open science as the optimal way to move our collective knowledge forward. The group was created in the fall 2024, when Pol Sol√© Navais joined the Wallenberg Laboratory, Institute of Medicine, University of Gothenburg.

## Highlights  

{% capture text %}

Our research group investigates the fundamental mechanisms of human development through the lens of genetic variation. We focus on the following key questions: 1) How does genetic variation affect traits that are essential for human development and survival? 2) How does the interplay between the maternal and fetal genomes shape these traits? 3) How do these genetic effects translate into molecular pathways and cellular mechanisms? 4) What forces allow genetic variation affecting fitness traits tbe passed down through inheritance? Adressing these questions will provide us with enhanced knowledge for human health, potentially leading to improved diagnostics and therapeutic interventions for pregnancy complications. We tackle these questions by integrating computational biology, experimentation, genomics, and large-scale data analysis.

Our team works on projects related to the genetics of pregnancy loss, gestational duration, and other reproductive and pregnancy traits. We have established a robust pipeline for distinguishing fetal from maternal effects, which allows us to integrate our discoveries with regulatory and epigenetic data from relevant tissues and cell types. Most of our work is largely collaborative, and we are part of several large international genetic consortia, such as the Nordic Collaboration for Women's Health, the Early Growth Genetics Consortium and the EAGLE Consortium. Additionally, we model large pedigrees (spanning up to four generations) and detailed phenotypic information from millions of individuals from Swedish register data to inform our genetic studies.

We are a team of biologists, engineers, mathematicians and clinicians, at different stages of our careers that work together to meet team and individual goals. We are constantly on the look-out for motivated and talended post-docs and master students who share our passion for understanding the genetic basis of human development.
