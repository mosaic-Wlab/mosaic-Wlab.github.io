# Curiosity-driven research with clinical potential     

We are an interdisciplinary team, a scientific mosaic, driven by curiosity to answer critical questions in reproductive and perinatal medicine. By integrating computational biology with large-scale genetic and registry data, we aim to understand the mechanisms behind pregnancy loss and other pregnancy and neonatal outcomes. Our ultimate goal is to transform reproductive biology and advance molecular diagnostics. We believe in collaborative work and open science as the optimal way to move our collective knowledge forward. We are based at the Wallenberg Laboratory, Institute of Medicine, University of Gothenburg.

## Highlights  

{% capture text %}

At Pol's group we try to answer some of the following questions: How does genetic variation affect traits that are crucial for human development and survival? How do the maternal and fetal genomes as well as their interplay, shape these traits? What are the cellular consequences in terms of molecular pathways and mechanisms involved? Why is genetic variation affecting fitness traits passed down through inheritance? Are the genetics of pregnancy loss similar to those of embryo implantation? Adressing these questions will provide us with enhanced knowledge on the mechanisms behind these traits and, potentially, develop improved diagnostic tools and treatments. The research in our laboratory aims at tackling these questions by integrating computational biology, experimentation, genomics, and large-scale data analysis.
