# Curiosity-driven research with clinical potential     

We are an interdisciplinary team, a scientific mosaic, driven by curiosity to answer critical questions in reproductive and perinatal medicine. By integrating computational biology with large-scale genetic and registry data, we aim to understand the mechanisms behind pregnancy loss and other pregnancy and neonatal outcomes. Our ultimate goal is to transform reproductive biology and advance molecular diagnostics. We believe in collaborative work and open science as the optimal way to move our collective knowledge forward. We are based at the Wallenberg Laboratory, Institute of Medicine, University of Gothenburg.

## Highlights  

{% capture text %}

At Pol's group we try to answer some of the following questions: How does genetic variation affect traits that are crucial for human development and survival? How do the maternal and fetal genomes as well as their interplay, shape these traits? What are the cellular consequences in terms of molecular pathways and mechanisms involved? Why is genetic variation affecting fitness traits passed down through inheritance? Adressing these questions will provide us with enhanced knowledge on the mechanisms behind these traits and, potentially, develop improved diagnostic tools and treatments. We tackle these questions by integrating computational biology, experimentation, genomics, and large-scale data analysis.

Our ongoing projects are related to the genetics of pregnancy loss, gestational duration, and other reproductive traits. We have established a robust pipeline for distinguishing fetal from maternal effects, which allows us to integrate our discoveries with regulatory and epigenetic data from relevant tissues and cell types. Most of our work is largely collaborative, and we are part of several large international genetic consortia, such as the Nordic Collaboration for Women's Health, the Early Growth Genetics Consortium and the EAGLE Consortium. Additionally, we work with rich register data from Sweden to inform our genetic studies by modelling large pedigrees (up to four generations) and detailed phenotypic information from millions of individuals.

We are a team of biologists, engineers, mathematicians and clinicians, at different stages of our careers that work together to meet team and individual goals. We are constantly on the look-out for motivated and talended post-docs and master students, and strive to create an scientifically challenging research environment.
