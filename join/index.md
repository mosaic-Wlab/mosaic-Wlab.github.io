Positions at our University, including our lab, are usually listed on the [vacancies website from the University of Gothenburg](https://www.gu.se/en/work-at-the-university-of-gothenburg/vacancies) and below. We are always on the look-out for computational postdocs and master students excited about reproductive genetics.  

We try to keep the list of open positions updated, but we might have additional opportunities that are not listed. If you are interested in joining our lab, please [contact Pol]({{ site.baseurl }}/contact) by sending an email with your CV and your motivations to set up a time to discuss your interest.
